INSIDE THE PROGRAM

messages sent are formated like this:
    client_id + ":::" + client_name + ":::" + "time" + ":::" + actual_msg
exemple:
    "7:::valentin:::14-05-23 19h01:::je programme un truc de fou l√†"
note:
    server id is 0 (zero)



Problems/bugs:
Close the client interface with the window's close button, misdisconnect him, possibly creating bugs later

If client send a message containing "spliter" character (:::), the part after the "spliter" will be cut from the sended message
